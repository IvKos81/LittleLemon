#Little Lemon Restaurant - Student Project

My project is small react app for restaurant webpage.
It contains some sections:
Intro - greeting section
Promo - section with day dishes
Menu - Online menu available in restaurant

Because, it is a mock project, I didn`t make many sections or menu positions.
My project is responsive and can be used from mobile phones.

Some tips: 

* because on local machines exists a CORS restrictions for fetch, I emulated external API in local api.js. So, when you click the submit button in booking form, data sending is mock to api,js file.

* input validation maked with html\css code

Instructions:

Download app.
Start the react server
On first screen you can click logo, intro, promo links.
If you will click Reserve table button - page with booking table form will be open
After filling and sending form you will be moved to booking confirmation page. On this page you will see confirmation of booking with all your details.
If you will press Back to main page button - you will be moved back to main page.
